# Modern-Animation-Using-GSAP & Lenis
You should try this animation atleast once. I had included CDN's for GSAP, and Lenis.
GSAP -> It is the very powerfull animation JavaScript library.
Lenis -> An open source platform which you can use it for smooth scrolling.<br />

# Steps :
<ul>
  <li>Unzip the folder</li>
  <li>Open the HTML file</li>
</ul>

# Scroll to see Animation
